\section{The DesignAPI: A Shared Interface Between Design and Code}
With the vision of aligning frontend disciplines, sharing principles and encouraging interchange,
the DesignAPI serves as an innovative shared interface between design and code. Seven categories, 29
cards and 12 message templates. All beautifully designed with content based on research, real
experiences and newly imagined best practices with the goal of harmonizing the two disciplines.

This chapter will present all final assets of the DesignAPI.
