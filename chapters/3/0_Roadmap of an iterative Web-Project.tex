\section{Roadmap of an iterative Web-Project} % NOTE Maybe change title to include Project Managemnt
% Say that for better collaboration not only handoff but also project management is crucial.
% Why is traditional project management not really working. Agile is good (adoption grows and is now
% the new standard, find statistics), lean ux needs to be integrated, so also design can be as
% iterative as (possible) development.
In order to achieve the best collaboration between designers and developers, not only handoff
quality is important, but also the way project management is handled. It shapes how the team sees
the project and how they work together. In this chapter, I will outline how web projects are usually
set up, what challenges they face at different stages, the potential consequences of these
challenges and possible solutions for overcoming them.
