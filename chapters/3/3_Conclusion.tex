\subsection{Conclusion}
% To make great User Interfaces and User Experiences, it is not enough for designers to do their job
% and developers implementing designs. All disciplines need to work towards that goal and understand
% why something is done and why it is that way. Everyone should be able to understand why the stop
% button of their timer app is that big and at the top right, instead of mini and at the bottom
% left.

As seen in this chapter, the way a project is managed and what rules the team follows, have 
a huge impact on the outcome. While the traditional Waterfall model can work for projects with a
fixed scope, it may not be the way to go for design focused web projects as they are usually prone
to change while in development.

To make great user interfaces and user experiences, it is crucial that all disciplines work closely
together and understand the \textit{why} behind decisions. Agile methods like Lean UX and the
combination with Scrum seem to be one of the best ways to achieve this change in culture.
Breaking down silos and integrating engineers into the design process will lead to better, more
technically feasible, and developer-friendly designs. 

Promoting more informal meetings like collaborative design sessions can also help designers and
developers to understand requirements of each others work better.
