\subsection{Developing a Solution}
Creating something that tailors to the struggles of both designers and engineers requires a
carefully considered solution. Guided by a clear vision, an innovative idea, a solid system and a
flexible design language were developed.

\subsubsection{The Vision of High Quality Collaboration}
Before starting to think about solutions, the actual needs of the parties have to be examined and a
clear vision needs to be set. To do this, the data of the survey done beforehand was used as a
foundation.

\begin{description}
    \item[The need for cross-disciplinary knowledge] - Both designers and developers would benefit
          from more knowledge about the other discipline at places where it matters most. If designers
          knew why using variables for design tokens or Figma Auto-Layout in frames matters to devs, they
          could use these things more intentionally. Similarly, if developers knew how to use design tools
          to their advantage, the could skip tedious back-and-forth conversations and implement screens
          with more confidence.
    \item[The need for a shared understanding of components] - Designers should be aware that their
          structure of designs can, to a certain degree, mimic the structure of code. As component based
          development is the golden standard of web development, both parties should share certain
          principles and best practices for components.
    \item[The need for more frequent communication] - Communication is key for a frictionless
          collaboration and results in great products. As stated in the book Lean UX, the user experience
          is "created by a team, not an individual user interface designer".
          \directcite[63]{gothelfLeanUXProduktentwicklung2016} As remote working models become more
          popular, this becomes an even bigger challenge.
    \item[The need for common best practices] - Knowing when and why to use which tools and
          techniques would benefit the design handoffs drastically. Even more so, avoiding bad practices
          could save hours of reworking documentation, redoing designs or code implementations.

These four needs should be satisfied by the solution. The following sentence should serve as a
vision for the practical project.

% Something fancy incorporating all the needs specified above
"A solution that bridges disciplines, builds shared understanding, educates all parties and
encourages communication"
