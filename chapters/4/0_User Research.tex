After looking at the basics of web design and how projects can be structured in an iterative and
collaborative way, we have discovered there are practices that can help to bring design and code
closer together. In this chapter, we take a closer look at how designers and developers work
together in the real world. 

This was done by conducting a qualitative survey and doing interviews with professionals. The shared
goal was to find common pain points, practical solutions and best practices. Also, by inviting both
disciplines to participate and tailoring the questions to their respective fields, I aimed to get a
holistic view of how they perceive each other's work and how well their expectations to each other
align.

% Even when working iteratively or agile there are still handoffs between design and development.
% This is inevitable and has to be done right.
