After looking at the basics of web design and how projects can be structured in an iterative and
collaborative way, we have discovered there are practices that can help to bring design and code
closer together. In this chapter, we take a closer look at how designers and developers work
together in the real world. 

This was done by conducting a qualitative survey. The goal was to find common pain points, practical
solutions and best practices. Also, by inviting both disciplines to participate and tailoring the
questions to their respective fields, I aimed to get a holistic view of how they perceive each
other's work and how well their expectations to each other align. 

% TODO: Add paragraph that links to the 5th chapter (interviews)

% Even when working iteratively or agile there are still handoffs between design and development.
% This is inevitable and has to be done right.
