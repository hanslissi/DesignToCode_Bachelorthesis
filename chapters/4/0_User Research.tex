After looking at the basics of web design and how projects can be structured in an iterative and
collaborative way, it has become evident that there are practices that can help to bring design and
code closer together. In this chapter, we take a closer look at how designers and developers work
collaboratively in the real world. 

This was done by conducting a qualitative survey. The goal was to find common pain points, practical
solutions and best practices. Also, by inviting both disciplines to participate and tailoring the
questions to their respective fields, it was possible to get a holistic view of how they perceive
each other's work and how well their expectations of each other align.
