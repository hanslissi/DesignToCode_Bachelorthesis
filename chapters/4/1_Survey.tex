\subsubsection{Goal of the Survey}
The goal of this qualitative survey was to gather in-depth data about designer-developer
collaboration patterns and identify key friction points in their workflows. 

\subsubsection{Survey Design}
Although the survey was designed to be answered by both designers and developers, the questions were
tailored to their fields. After an initial question about their role, the survey branched into two
paths. One for designers and one for developers. While the structure and order of the questions was
similar, the wording and focus of some was slighlty adjusted. The thought behind that was to make it
easy for both parties to answer, while being able to compare and align the answers later on.

Examples of questions include: % NOTE show them in a better way than a table...
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|m{7.5cm}|m{7.5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Designer Question} & \textbf{Developer Question} \\
        \hline
        How would you rate your understanding of web development? & How comfortable are you working with design tools like Figma?  \\ 
        \hline
        What do you think were the main reasons for these discrepancies between design and implementation? & What issues do you commonly face with design handoffs and implementing designs? \\
        \hline
        When making a new version [\dots], how do you communicate these changes to the developers? & When a component needs to be changed, [\dots] how do you expect the designer to communicate these changes? \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Formulating the questions in this way allowed for seeing if there are any discrepancies in the
workflow and how expectations align. The majority of questions were multiple choice, with some
open-ended ones to allow for some more reflective answers. 

As the survey was designed to reach both beginners and experienced professionals, the survey was
distributed to a wide range of channels: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two small web development companies that focus on design (Webduett and Userbrain) 
    \item A list of Design and Software Development students of FH Joanneum
    \item LinkedIn connections
    \item Personal designer and developer contacts
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Presentation of Survey Results}
Over a duration of 30 days, 22 people responded to the survey. 11 of which considered themselves
primarily as designers, 8 as developers and 3 were not in the target group. The majority of
designers have not yet had as many years of professional experience as the developers.

% be suitable here)

The survey further supported online claims of Figma being the most popular design tool. 90\% of
designers said they use Figma for designing interfaces. Tools like Photoshop are still used by
~30\%.

When asked about their understanding of the other discipline, the majority of designers rated their
web development knowledge as "3/5 starts - HTML, CSS, JavaScript tried it, know a lil bit". 2 of
them even rated it as "5/5 stars - Honestly could do the developers job :)". Also Developers seem to
know their way around design tools like Figma with 75\% rating their comfort level as 3/5 or higher.
Responses suggest that while there is a general understanding of the other disciplines tools, there
is room for improvement.

81\% of designers said they have experienced discrepancies between design and implementation. The
most common reasons were time constraints, misinterpretation by developers and "Special
cases like complex animations, Popups, Microinteractions". When asked about the main issues with
design handoffs, developers selected "Too few designed states (missing hover, focus, \dots)",
unclarity of responsive layouts and "Special cases like complex animations, Popups,
Microinteractions". 
This suggests that the discrepancies
